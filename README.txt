NETS 1500 Project: Traverse and Learn
By: Patricia Columbia-Walsh & Quentin Cagnon

Description: Our project helps people learn how to traverse graphs using different algorithms such as BFS, DFS,
Dikstras, and topological sort. Upon running the Main class the program will prompt you if you want to use your own
graphs or premade graphs. Depending on what the user decides they will then be asked which algorithm they want to
run/learn. After that a visualization of the algorithm will appear in a new window and show the user step by step how
to traverse it. The order and what is happening on each step will appear at the top of the screen, so
that the user can learn and see a visualization of how these algorithms work. For example, the current elements of
the stack in Depth First Search are shown at each step.

How to run: Run Main.java.

Categories Used:
We used the graph and graph algorithms category by implementing different algorithms on given graphs.

Task Breakdown:
make graphs for each algorithm/topic - Quentin
BFS - Patricia
DFS - Patricia
Dijkstra - Patricia
Topological sort - Patricia
Link Algorithms to Visualization - Quentin
Visualization - Quentin

Changes Made After Proposal:
We decided to change STC to Topological sort because it made more sense to do algorithms that were more similar.
Especially because the way the visualization works is step by step, whereas for STC you could identify all in one step.
