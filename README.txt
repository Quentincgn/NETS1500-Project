NETS 1500 Project: Traverse and Learn
By: Patricia Columbia-Walsh & Quentin Cagnon

Description: Our project helps people learn how to traverse graphs using different algorithms such as BFS, DFS,
Dikstras, and topological sort. Upon running each file a pre-made graph will appear in all black and the nodes will
turn green upon being visited. The order and what is happening on each step will appear at the top of the screen, so
that the user can learn and see a visualization of how these algorithms work. For example, the current elements of
the stack in Depth First Search are shown at each step.

How to run: There are four classes BFSVisualization, DFSVisualization, DijkstraVisualization, and TSVisualization. In
order to use the program the user must run each file and a screen will appear with the graph/visualization.

Categories Used:
We used the graph and graph algorithms category by implementing different algorithms on given graphs.

Task Breakdown:
make graphs for each algorithm/topic - Quentin
BFS - Patricia
DFS - Patricia
Dijkstra - Patricia
Topological sort - Patricia
Visualization - Quentin

Changes Made After Proposal:
We decided to change STC to Topological sort because it made more sense to do algorithms that were more similar.
Especially because the way the visualization works is step by step, whereas for STC you could identify all in one step.
